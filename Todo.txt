void eval(char *cmdline); ->working on, i think its done
int builtin_cmd(char **argv); -> working on  - Aidan (probably done?)
    - tsh should support the following built-in commands:
    1. The quit command terminates the shell. - done
    2. The jobs command lists all background jobs. - done
    3. The bg <job> command restarts <job> by sending it a SIGCONT signal, 
    and then runs it in the background. The <job> argument can either be a PID or a JID.
    4. The fg <job> command restarts <job> by sending it a SIGCONT signal, 
    and then runs it in the foreground.  The <job> argument can be either a PID or a JID.
void do_bgfg(char **argv); - aidan (done maybe)
void waitfg(pid_t pid); - aidan (done maybe)

no promises on the code i completed, theres definitely something there though

void sigchld_handler(int sig);
void sigtstp_handler(int sig);
void sigint_handler(int sig);
